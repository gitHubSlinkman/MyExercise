```

## Load packages and required functions

```{r}
require( here )                        # Used to determine project location.
require( tidyverse )                   # I live in the tidyverse.
require( lubridate )                   # For date-time processing.
require( flextable )

source("D:/R-Projects/MyExercise/functions/read_garmin_csv_file.R")
source("D:/R-Projects/MyExercise/functions/find_last_history_date_time.R")
source("D:/R-Projects/MyExercise/functions/display_tibble.R")
```

## Find project data directory

```{r}
project_directory <-                  # Determine project location in 
  here()                              # operating system file system.

data_directory <-                     # Build file path to data directory.
  file.path( project_directory,
             "data")     
```

## Build an array of all activirty files in data directory

```{r}
files <-                              # Build an array to hold full project
  find_all_garmin_csv_files(          # file paths.
     data_directory )

files <-                             # Ensure files in ascending order by 
  sort( files )                      # by date.
```
  
## Read first Garmin Activity file by date.

```{r}
History <-                            # Read first Garmin csv files and save 
  read_garmin_csv_file( files[1]) %>% # History and ensuer that rows are in
    arrange( date_time )              # chronological order

display_tibble( History )
```

## Read second activities file

```{r}
Activities <-                         # Read first Garmin csv files and save 
  read_garmin_csv_file( files[2]) %>% # History and ensuer that rows are in
    arrange( date_time )              # chronological order

display_tibble( Activities )
```

## Merge Activities tiblles with History

```{r}

History <- 
  History %>% 
    add_row( Activities )

```
